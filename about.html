    	<h1> Interests </h1>
	<h2> Programming </h2>
	<p>Coding is my favourite hobby. I have been doing it for about 3 years and I love it as much as I did when I started. As of right now I am proficient in 4 languages: Python, HTML, Batch and C#, but I am learning more quickly. I have made 6 big, open-source programs.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h2> Sports | Gymnastics </h2>
	<p>Gymnastics is my favourite sport and has been for many years. I am in competitive gymnastics and I really enjoy it. I really hope to be able to represent Hugh Boyd in High School Gymnastics next year. Gymnastics is one of the hardest sports in the world and I like the challenges it throws at me. 
I also volunteer during varying gymnastics competitions for younger athletes.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h2> Sports | Track and Field </h2>
	<p>Track and Field is a part of my life every spring when I join the Dixon Track and Field team. My main events are sprinting short distances and long jump. As mentioned in my achievements, I came first in the 200m sprint and 3rd in long jump at last year's BC Track and Field Championships.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h2> Master of Ceremony </h2>

	<p>Being a quite social and talkative guy, I love Mcing and often get chosen to MC different school events. So far my biggest opportunities have been: </p>
<p>~ MCing the grade 7 farewell assembly </p>
<p>~ And a month ago I MCed our annual Christmas concert dressed up as Santa Clause where our principal Mr. Juhazs sat on my lap to tell me his wishes.</p>
