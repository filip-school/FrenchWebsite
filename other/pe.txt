## How did you demonstrate teamwork in the games?​

I let everyone have a chance to get the ball or the item we were playing with.​ I cooperated and communicated with my team to have the highest success rate.​​​​​ I'm the type of person​​ who will lend a helping hand whenever needed. I'm the type of person who tries to understand why people might be underperforming, then see what we can do as a team to help them get back up to speed. I like to help other people so we can all be more effective in reaching our team goals​. I try to encourage people and keep high spirits, so my teammates don't feel down and keep trying their best. This is the type of teammate I am.

## What are some of the challenges of working as a team?  How did you work to overcome these?

One of the big challenges is participation. Getting everyone to listen and share their ideas with the whole group was a difficult task. On my team, people usually didn't care and they would do anything to kind of stand back and let everyone else do the planning. Also, different people had different visions so everyone had diverse ideas about how to complete the task. Our group listened to everyone and we tried most of their ideas and suggestions. When an idea worked we would keep going with it and maybe tweak it a little bit based on our group's suggestions.



## What strategies helped your teams communicate successfully?

Having votes, having one person talking at a time and having respect. Having votes was effective because ​everyone (or most of the team) would be in agreement on what we were doing. If one person decides the whole idea, than the rest of the team might not want to do it. Having one person talk at a time worked well because we weren't talking over each other and most of the time everyone new what to do. Having respect was important so nobody felt discouraged to share their ideas.



## What did you learn about teamwork?

That teamwork and getting everyone to cooperate was a difficult task, harder than the task itself sometimes. Especially if the task is hard and the group is large, the teamwork is much more difficult.  Teamwork is easy, if everyone agrees and are on the same tracks as the rest of the team. If the teamwork if good the task is significantly easier to achieve. 


## How did you demonstrate leadership in the games? (Be specific)

I found people's weaknesses and strengths and used it to our team's advantage. For example, if Bob is really good at sprinting, but horrible at jumping, I won't make Bob try dunks on the basketball hoop, I'll focus on his strengths, which in this case is running.​ Doing this, the people with different athletic abilities or the less talented people have a chance to feel successful​ and know that their skills have helped the team. I shared my ideas and opinions and communicated with my team so everyone knew what they were supposed to do.​​​​ If everyone is on the same page, than we'll have more fun and have a higher success rate.​​

## What are some of the challenges when trying to lead a team?

Sometimes it is hard to get everyone to participate and cooperate as a team. If some people on the team are dominating the conversation while others sit silently or don't participate, the leader should stop the process and ask each person what they want to do and their opinion on the subject.

Another difficulty is motivation. Sometimes the members of your group just don't care. They will stand back and agree with whatever you say so they don't have to do work. They are just not committed to do the task at hand.



## What did you learn about leadership?​​​

Leadership is hard. Being a good leader is a tough task, but with the right "ingredients" and strategies, you can be a great leader. Also, a leader should not be SUPER harsh, they need a little bit of wiggle room so the people you're leading have fun and like you as a leader. I feel that I learned 3 important things about leadership:​ Being an active listener, being flexible/understanding and being respectful towards others.​ It's important to listen to your ​​​​peers because the ideas or suggestions they give might help your team succeed. You need to be flexible and understanding if one of your teammates doesn't do what he/she is supposed to or if he/she is performing poorly. I understand that people have a variety of different skill levels, so the person that is bad at basketball, could excel at soccer.​ Last but definitely not least, I need to be respectful to the other team as well as mine. If we win, we won't brag about winning, but congratulate the opposing team for trying their best.
